JavaScript can make a webpage interactive in many ways. For this assignment, you are going to take the index.html page with meme image and make the image move around the screen using a Start button. The image should move until the Stop button is clicked.

## Objectives
* Write code to create 2 buttons on the index.html page
* Code those buttons to trigger Events in JavaScript using functions
* The Start button should call a function that moves the meme image around the index.html page
* The Stop button should call a function that stops the meme image from moving around the index.html page
* Apply Event Driven programming
* User Acceptance Test the Events

## Requirements
* Write HTML code to create the Start button.
* Write HTML code to create the Stop button.
* Create a JavaScript function to enable/disable the Start button.
* This function should call another function that moves the meme image around the page.
