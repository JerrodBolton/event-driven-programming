* Create a new webpage called game.html
* Add a button to this html page to play a game.
* You can choose a game of your own (NOT guess a number) or use the rules below to implement at least one random #, some math, conditionals (if/else if/else), and have all the output to the web page from the .js through the use of “.innerHTML“ in the JavaScript.
* In a separate code.js page, write a function to implement the game (the function called when the button is clicked)
* Comment the function to describe what it does.
* Create another function that takes a parameter and uses this input value and outputs results.
* Comment almost every line of HTML and JavaScript code demonstrating you know what it does.
* Link the .js file to the main HTML file.
* Test the program and ensure it works properly.

Craps Rules

Generate 2 random #s between 1 and 6/output

Calculate the sum/output

If sum = 7 or sum = 11, output CRAPS – you lose!

Else if die1 = die2 and die1 % 2 = 0

Note – die1 %2 = 0 means die1 is even and Else if die1 = die2 and die1 % 2 = 0 means the die are equal (doubles) and even (2,4,6).
